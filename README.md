# Welcome to RF Tools!

These utilities allow quick templates to grab RF samples at high resoltion for things like tagging, analysis, and surveys. Other templates can provide good starting points for advanced designs.

Programs here are good "how-to's" for SDR templates where IO is important. 

What's Inside:
  * [RF_Capture] - UHD USRP SDR capture tool and template. Optimized for scientific sampling with Ettus USB3 SDRs.
  * [FPGA_Exploration] - FPGA design projects and templates. Mostly for SDRs.
