# Welcome to the FPGA Directory!

Here you will find design projects and templates for common SDRs. Mosts templates are reference designs privided by the manufacturer.

What's Inside:
  * [B205mini] - Ettus Research B2xx mini ISE 14.7 compatible template for the Sparta 6 FPGA included on their SDR. This is only with the "mini" model an supports all FPGA sizes for their line. Currently, the ISE project has the 6slx150csg484-3 selected as the target build as default (for a b205i mini wit the larger FPGA). Make sure to select the proper target FPGA when building.
